# RoHerb Landing v3 — Asset Plan & AI Image Prompts

**Creative direction:** The book is fully **illustrated** (no real photos). It is a **modern, high-quality recipe book** in **perfect condition**—visually super appealing. When the book is shown, it must be **clearly a recipe book**: clear text (recipe titles, ingredients, steps), herb illustrations, and clear sections (e.g. “What you need”, “How to make”). Premium, pristine, not old or vintage.

## Book dimensions (use in prompts where the book is shown)

**Real-world specs** — the book is large-format and substantial:

- **Weight:** 4.96 lb / 2.25 kg  
- **Size:** 9.0 × 2.0 × 13.4 in / 23 × 4.9 × 34 cm  
  - **Width:** 9 in (23 cm)  
  - **Spine thickness:** 2 in (4.9 cm) — noticeably thick  
  - **Height:** 13.4 in (34 cm) — taller than wide, portrait orientation  

So in visuals: a **large, thick, portrait-format book** (like a substantial art or coffee-table book), not a small paperback or slim journal. The spine is wide; the book has real presence and weight.

Right page: a "How to make" or "Method" section with a few clear steps, and another herb or botanical illustration. The layout is clean, structured, and obviously a recipe book—not abstract or decorative only.

The book looks modern, premium, and visually super appealing—not old, not vintage, not worn. Optional: a couple of fresh herb sprigs beside the book. Aspect ratio 4:3, soft natural lighting.
