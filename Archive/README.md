# Archive

This folder contains files that are **not used by the current RoHerb landing project** but were kept for reference or history. Nothing here is needed for the live site (index.html) or the main draft (roherb-landing-v4.html).

## Contents

- **roherb-landing-v3.html** — Previous version of the landing page (superseded by v4 / index).
- **LATEST VERSION/** — Reference material (e.g. “The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding Civilization” book in .mhtml). If you use a hero video path like `LATEST VERSION/Hero_Video_1920x1080_HB.mp4` in v4, either restore this folder and add the video here or update the path in the HTML.
- **Forgotten Home Apothecary.html** + **Forgotten Home Apothecary_files/** — Saved copy of an external “Forgotten Home Apothecary” webpage (reference only).
- **Global Creative Studio and Food & Beverage Consultancy by The Herball.html** + **_files/** — Saved copy of “The Herball” webpage (reference only).
- **extra_info.md** — Extra notes/reference.
- **image_1.jpg** — Unused image asset.
- **hf_20260217_002656_….svg** — Unused/generated SVG.
- **BACKGROUND-ILLUSTRATIONS-REQUIREMENTS.md**, **ROHERB-V3-ASSET-PROMPTS.md**, **SITE-STRUCTURE-SUMMARY.md** — Old project docs and prompts (reference only).
